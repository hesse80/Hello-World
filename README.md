# Hello-World

Hi there!
This is Elijah. I married three years ago and I have a daughter whose name is Yerin.
She's very pretty and smart. :)

Today, I made a first repository. I don't have any idea about this because I'm beginner.
But I can give you my word. I will be a master of GitHub as soon as possilbe.

Take care everyone and I hope all is well with you.
